**Applied Data Science I: Scientific Computing & Python**

In Unit I, students gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work. Successful completion of Unit I is a prerequisite for enrollment in Unit II.

**PROJECT 1**

In this project students use Python to compute Mersenne numbers, using the Lucas-Lehmer test to identify Mersenne numbers that are prime. They use Python data structures and core programming principles such as loops to implement their solution. In addition, students learn to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes as a faster solution for checking if numbers are prime, learning about the importance of algorithm time complexity.

**PROJECT 2**

In this project students use Object Oriented Programming to create a class that represents a geometric point. They define methods that describe common operations with points such as adding two points together and finding the distance between two points. Finally, they write a K-means clustering algorithm that uses the previous defined point class.

**PROJECT 3**

In this project students use basic Python data structures, functions, and control program flow to answer posed questions over medical data from the British NHS on prescription drugs. They also work with fundamental data wrangling techniques such as joining data sets together, splitting data into groups, and aggregating data into summary statistics.

**PROJECT 4**

In this project students use the Python package pandas to perform data analysis on a prescription drug data set from the British NHS. They answer questions such as identifying what medical practices prescribe opioids at an usually high rate and what practices are prescribing substantially more rare drugs compared to the rest of the medical practices. They also use statistical concepts like z-score to help identify the aforementioned practices.
